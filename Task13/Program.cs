    PHP
PHP is a language built for creating dynamic web pages, and it runs on the server-side. 
Let’s say you just finished building a website without programming and now you want to be able to customize things further. 
You want to learn how to program the brains of the website, i.e. the back-end. 
A large number of websites and scripts are built using PHP, and web hosts often come with a list of one-click-install scripts. 
If you want to create a plugin for WordPress or work with the same script that runs Wikipedia, then PHP is for you. 
Practically all dynamic web hosts run PHP, and its very easy to get started with it. 
However, PHP has some issues, such as a messy syntax and certain inconsistencies and quirks. 
This means you should probably learn a different language if you just want to learn programming or you want to create an entirely new web app. 
However, PHP has improved over time, and if it fits your purposes, go ahead and learn it.

    Python
If you just want an easy and elegant language to learn programming, Python is a good choice. 
Unlike PHP and Javascript, which are made for the web, Python is a general-purpose language that is often used outside of websites. 
Python aims to be very readable, so even a beginner could figure out what some simple Python code accomplishes. 
Python has the unusual feature of using indentation to mark different parts of code. 
This makes the code look less cluttered, but can sometimes cause issues when copying code. 
Python is a good choice to go with if you don’t have a specific goal that fits with one of the other languages.

    Java and C#
Java and C# are two very similar programming languages that are well-optimized and have stricter rules to help prevent programming mistakes. 
Code in these languages need to be “compiled” into lower-level code before it runs, and all variables need to be “declared” with their name and type. 
They also enforce/encourage a methodology known as “object-oriented programming”, requiring all code to belong to an “object”.
People who program in these languages use an IDE to write their software in, which can provide various features to 
help with programming, such as auto-completion suggestions while they code, and automatic highlighting of certain errors. 
The rules in these languages will help you detect certain errors before you even run your code, which can be especially helpful when learning programming. However, 
Java or C# are not made for writing simple scripts, and they are not as popular for quickly creating dynamic websites.

    JavaScript
Since JavaScript runs in all browsers, it can be a good choice of language to learn. 
No installation is required, since it can immediately be tried out in the browser. 
JavaScript can be used for visual effects, but also for doing things without having to update the entire webpage. Modern web apps require JavaScript for many of their features. (For example, try loading Gmail without JavaScript.) 
JavaScript is also used in many web-related areas, such as creating browser extensions. It is often used for other areas that beginners might be interested in, such as creating AppScripts to work with Google Apps. 
If you are interested in doing any of these things, 
Javascript may be a good language to learn. However, Javascript has certain confusing parts, so if you’re not planning on using it for the above purposes, you can try a more elegant language such as Python.
